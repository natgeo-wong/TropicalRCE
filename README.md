This repository contains the analysis scripts and output for the **TropicalRCE** project, written in Julia.  We aim to investigate how RCE simulations differ from the tropical atmosphere and why.

## 0. Motivation

RCE simulations are often taken as an approximation to the tropical atmosphere.  However, from initial runs in the **[DiConv](https://github.com/natgeo-wong/DiConv)** project, we find that Cloud-Resolving RCE runs in the System of Atmospheric Modelling [(SAM)](http://rossby.msrc.sunysb.edu/~marat/SAM.html) v6.10.6, we find that the net energy balance at the surface is much greater than the tropical average O(40) W/m2.  The net energy balance in our runs at 302 K and equatorial insolation hovers at O(120) W/m2.  These results are not unique.  A recent study done by [Wing et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2020MS002138) as part of RCEMIP shows that for small domains (O(100)km in both horizontal directions), the mean surface energy balance is O(100) W/m2.

In a way, these results are somewhat expected, given that atmospheric transport out of the tropics is not accounted for in these small-domain CRMs.  However, even when accounting for large-scale vertical motion as a proxy for large-scale atmospheric motion and ascent in the tropics, the surface energy balance still hovers at O(120) W/m2.  Therefore, in this project, we aim to explore and understand the differences between our results in small-domain RCE simulations, and reanalysis data (ERA5) that acts as a proxy to observations.

## 1. Reanalysis and Observational Data

We first download the following [ERA5](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/qj.3803) Reanalysis data from the Climate Data Store:
* Surface Fluxes: Net Solar, Net Longwave, Sensible and Latent
* TOA Fluxes: Net Solar, Net Longwave
* Cloud Cover: Total, High (0-450 hPa), Medium (450-800 hPa), High (800-1000 hPa)
* Temperature: 2m Air Temperature, Surface, Pressure Lvl
* Total Column Water, Column Water Vapour
* Land-Sea Mask

We also download [GPM IMERG](https://gpm.nasa.gov/data/directory) precipitation data from the PMM website, and ETOPO1 grid data.

## Installation

To (locally) reproduce this project, do the following:

0. Download this code base. Notice that raw data are typically not included in the
   git-history and may need to be downloaded independently.
1. Open a Julia console and do:
   ```
   julia> ] activate .
    Activating environment at `~/Projects/TropicalRCE/Project.toml`

   (TropicalRCE) pkg> instantiate
   (TropicalRCE) pkg> add GeoRegions#master SAMTools#master
   ```

This will install all necessary packages for you to be able to run the scripts and
everything should work out of the box.

*(Note: You need to install the #master versions of GeoRegions.jl and SAMTools.jl as of now.)*
