This repository contains the analysis scripts and output for the **TropicalRCE** project, written in Julia.  We aim to investigate how RCE simulations differ from the tropical atmosphere and why.

## Motivation

RCE simulations are often taken as an approximation to the tropical atmosphere.  However, from initial runs in the **[DiConv](https://github.com/natgeo-wong/DiConv)** project, we find that Cloud-Resolving RCE runs in the System of Atmospheric Modelling [(SAM)](http://rossby.msrc.sunysb.edu/~marat/SAM.html) v6.10.6, we find that the net energy balance at the surface is much greater than the tropical average O(40) W/m2.  The net energy balance in our runs at 302 K and equatorial insolation hovers at O(120) W/m2.  These results are not unique.  A recent study done by [Wing et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2020MS002138) as part of RCEMIP shows that for small domains (O(100)km in both horizontal directions), the mean surface energy balance is O(100) W/m2.

In a way, these results are somewhat expected, given that atmospheric transport out of the tropics is not accounted for in these small-domain CRMs.  However, even when accounting for large-scale vertical motion as a proxy for large-scale atmospheric motion and ascent in the tropics, the surface energy balance still hovers at O(120) W/m2.  Therefore, in this project, we aim to explore and understand the differences between our results in small-domain RCE simulations, and reanalysis data (ERA5) that acts as a proxy to observations.

## Installation

To (locally) reproduce this project, do the following:

0. Download this code base. Notice that raw data are typically not included in the
   git-history and may need to be downloaded independently.
1. Open a Julia console and do:
   ```
   julia> using Pkg
   julia> Pkg.activate("path/to/this/project")
   julia> Pkg.instantiate()
   ```

This will install all necessary packages for you to be able to run the scripts and
everything should work out of the box.
